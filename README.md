### Hey there! 👋🏻
My name is **Alexander**, I am a **passionate italian developer** that loves working with **Java** and the **Spigot API**. 
<br>
<br>
For years I have been working on **Minecraft plugins** and recently on **custom forks** of [PaperMC](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper), but I am trying to expand my horizons with programming languages like **C**, **Python**, **JavaScript** and more.
<br>
I am **open** to **creating new** exciting **projects** so feel free to **contact me** if you think you might need some help!
<br>
<br>
<!--Also, make sure to check out the **Pinned Repositories** section with my most **important works**.-->
I suggest you check out **BearCommands** in the **Pinned Repositories** section. This is my **latest work** on which I put so much effort and I would love some **feedback**!
