### Hey there! üëãüèª
My name is **Alexander**, I am a **passionate Italian developer** who loves working with **Java** and discovering new **technologies** and **frameworks** for his projects. 

For years I have been working on **Spigot plugins** for **Minecraft** and I also tried creating **custom forks** of [PaperMC](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper).
This gave me the chance to approach the coding world in a fun and entertaining way, while also enjoying seeing my creations improve the game.

Now I am looking to expand my horizons with programming languages and technologies like **JavaScript**, **Python**, **Github-Actions**, **Ansible**, **CentOS**, **Docker** and **more**!

I am **open** to **creating new** exciting **projects** so feel free to **contact me** if you think you might need some help!

Most of my public works are **Java libraries** that allow developers to **integrate** my code into **their projects**, while also making **their life easier**.
I suggest checking out **[YAMLParser](https://github.com/Fulminazzo/YAMLParser)** and **[MarkdownParser](https://github.com/Fulminazzo/MarkdownParser)**, two libraries created to edit and manage respectively **YAML** and **Markdown** files.

And if you have some spare time and you are a **Minecraft developer** as well, check out **[BearCommands](https://github.com/Fulminazzo/BearCommands)**. This is my **biggest work as of right now** on which I put so much effort and I would love some **feedback**!

## Current Goal
**Beat the longest streak:**
